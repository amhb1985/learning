#this is about some developed try/except Methode inside of our code
#as we can learn further we have 3 kind of Error .
# now we try to set 3 diffrent except for our first code:

items = ['a', 'b','c']

try:
    #we set 3 diffrent mistake in our code:
    myvar= a
    x = 10/0
    third = items[2]
    print("a")
except:
    print("Something went Wrong!")
    third = False
print("I wanna this to run")
