# so frist of all we must download the python progrom for win or fo the mac

'''
#windows 
for checking the install we can use this commend >>
python --version
then we can see the version of the our installed Python

#after that installing we can run the code >>
python 
 inside of the Terminal in win to run it

 #for the quit the python we can use this commend 
 quit()
'''
'''
some of the usefull commend for the terminal in win is:
    cd 
>> Print Working Directory 

    cd folder 
>> to change to a new folder

dir 
>> list folders and files


cd ..
go folder up
'''
#Mac or iOS
# so now we testing inside of the mac

#how we can test and see the version of Python under terminal in Mac:
# we can use this commend under the Terminal in mac:(its like win Terminal)
'''
 python3 -- version

# the 3rd week:
#its easy to tp it:
#x = 1
#print(x)

#its another one
'''
x = 2 
x = x + 2 
print (x)

# conditional Steps :
# its going to the Fals and True duration of the simple Example:
'''x = 5 
if x < 10 :
    print('smaller.')
if x > 20 :
    print('Bigger.')
print('Finish!')

## Repeated Steps:
# its a while process
# when we r changing  to the for example 1 we r see that
# come from 5 and then 5-1 till 1
