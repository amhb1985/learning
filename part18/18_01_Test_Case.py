# as the first code we use this code:

#for example define a Function for squre of X:
def square(x):
    return x * x

#01 first we must import it
import test
#then we print our result:
print('testing squre function')

#03. we must testning  testEquel >> ourFunction (the X), and the Answere
#>> when the answere will true , then comming TRUE
test.testEqual(square(10),100)
